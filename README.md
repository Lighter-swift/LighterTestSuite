</h2>

A test suite for Lighter.

This is in a separate package for two reasons:
- If the code generation fails, the code generator itself can't build anymore
  (w/o switching themes and stuff).
- to keep the Lighter download smaller, as this may contain bigger test
  databases.

It actually seems to require Swift 5.7 to get the plugin lookup in dependencies
to work (either on macOS commandline or in Xcode).
